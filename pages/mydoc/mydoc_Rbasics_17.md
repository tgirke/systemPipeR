## What is Shiny?

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/) is an R-based environment for building interactive web applications for
data analysis and exploration. Since most JavaScript code is autogenerated by
the environment, basic R knowledge is sufficient for developing Shiny apps. 
They can be deployed on local computers or web servers including custom and cloud-based servers (e.g.
AWS, GCP, shinyapp.io service). The basic structure of a Shiny app is an
`app.R` script containing the following components:

1. User interface
    
    ```r
    ui <- fluidPage()
    ```

2. Server function
    
    ```r
    server <- function(input, output) {}
    ```
3. Statement to run shiny app
    
    ```r
    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
    ```

Alternatively, the `ui` and `server` functions can be organized in two script files, a `ui.R` and a `server.R` script, respectively. 

## Develop and test Shiny app locally

Open R and set session to parent directory (here `myappdir`) containing shiny script `app.R`, and the
run it with the `runApp()` function. A sample `app.R` script for testing can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/GEN242/gh-pages/_vignettes/07_Rbasics/shinyapp/app.R).


```r
library(shiny)
runApp("myappdir") # To show code in app, add argument: display.mode="showcase" 
```
This will open the app in a web browser.

## Deploy on web server

This can be done on local or cloud systems. An easy solution is to get an account on [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/)
and then deploy Shiny apps there. For details, see [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/deploy/).


```r
setwd("myappdir")
library(rsconnect)
deployApp()
```

## Example Shiny app

The following Shiny app is hosted on `shinyapps.io` and embedded into the markdown (or html) source of this page
using the following iframe syntax:


```r
<iframe src="https://tgirke.shinyapps.io/diamonds/" style="border: none; width: 880px; height: 900px"></iframe>
```

## Learning Shiny

The Shiny section on the Rstudio site contains excellent [tutorials](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/).
In addition, users may want to explore the example apps included in the `shiny` package. This can be
done by loading the individual examples (see [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/)) or saving
the code to a user writable directory like this:


```r
mydir <- system.file("examples", package="shiny")
dir.create('my_shiny_test_dir')
file.copy(mydir, "my_shiny_test_dir", recursive=TRUE)
setwd("my_shiny_test_dir/examples")
runApp("01_hello") # Runs first example app in directory 
dir() # Lists available Shiny examples (directories). 
```
