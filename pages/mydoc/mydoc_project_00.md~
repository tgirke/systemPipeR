## Introduction

During the tutorial sessions of this class all students will perform the basic
data analysis of three NGS Workflows including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and VAR-Seq.
In addition, every student will work in a group of 3-5 students on a Challenge
Project addressing a specific data analysis task within one of the three NGS
Workflows. Students will also present a scientific paper closely related to
their challenge topic (see
[here](http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/mydoc/mydoc_paper_presentations.html)).
To facilitate teamwork among group members, each course project will be
assigned a private GitHub repository (see
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Im2mwX8NJ9FSZB2CVxoevTxttr2wzoG9ybL_GMMNN4A/edit#gid=1818533395)).

The results of the Challenge Projects will be presented by each student group
during the last week of the course (see Slideshow Template
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VJzj9L75HdGel-mnAbNLYc9Wmdxg3aQP8YmrWG3AsTU/edit)).
In addition, each student will write a detailed analysis report of the assigned
course project. This report needs to include all analysis steps of the
corresponding NGS Workflow (_e.g._ full RNA-Seq analysis) as well as the
code and results of the Challenge Project. The final project reports should be written
in R Markdown. A basic tutorial on R Markdown is available [here](http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/mydoc/mydoc_Rbasics_15.html). 
Both the R Markdown script (`.Rmd`) along with the rendered HTML or PDF report will be submitted to each student's private GitHub repository by or
before June 8. The expected structure of the final project report is outlined below.
