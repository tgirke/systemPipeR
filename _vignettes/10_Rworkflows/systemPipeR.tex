\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/systemPipeR.html}{\emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}}} provides flexible utilities for building and running automated end-to-end analysis workflows for a wide range of research applications, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments, such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and Ribo-Seq (H Backman and Girke 2016). Important features include a uniform workflow interface across different data analysis applications, automated report generation, and support for running both R and command-line software, such as NGS aligners or peak/variant callers, on local computers or compute clusters (Figure 1). The latter supports interactive job submissions and batch submissions to queuing systems of clusters. For instance, \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} can be used with most command-line aligners such as \texttt{BWA} (Li 2013; Li and Durbin 2009), \texttt{HISAT2} (Kim, Langmead, and Salzberg 2015), \texttt{TopHat2} (Kim et al. 2013) and \texttt{Bowtie2} (Langmead and Salzberg 2012), as well as the R-based NGS aligners \href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/Rsubread.html}{\emph{\texttt{Rsubread}}} (Liao, Smyth, and Shi 2013) and \href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/gmapR.html}{\emph{\texttt{gsnap (gmapR)}}} (Wu and Nacu 2010). Efficient handling of complex sample sets (\emph{e.g.} FASTQ/BAM files) and experimental designs are facilitated by a well-defined sample annotation infrastructure which improves reproducibility and user-friendliness of many typical analysis workflows in the NGS area (Lawrence et al. 2013).

The main motivation and advantages of using \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} for complex data analysis tasks are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Facilitates the design of complex NGS workflows involving multiple R/Bioconductor packages
\item
  Common workflow interface for different NGS applications
\item
  Makes NGS analysis with Bioconductor utilities more accessible to new users
\item
  Simplifies usage of command-line software from within R
\item
  Reduces the complexity of using compute clusters for R and command-line software
\item
  Accelerates runtime of workflows via parallelization on computer systems with multiple CPU cores and/or multiple compute nodes
\item
  Improves reproducibility by automating analyses and generation of analysis reports
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Figure 1:} Relevant features in \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}}.
Workflow design concepts are illustrated under (A \& B). Examples of
\emph{systemPipeR's} visualization functionalities are given under (C).

A central concept for designing workflows within the \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} environment
is the use of workflow management containers. In previous versions, \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}}
used a custom command-line interface called \emph{\texttt{SYSargs}} (see Figure 3) and for
this purpose will continue to be supported for some time. With the latest \href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/systemPipeR.html}{Bioconductor Release 3.9},
we are adopting for this functionality the widely used community standard
\href{https://www.commonwl.org/}{Common Workflow Language} (CWL) for describing
analysis workflows in a generic and reproducible manner, introducing \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}}
workflow control class (see Figure 2). Using this community standard in \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}}
has many advantages. For instance, the integration of CWL allows running \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}}
workflows from a single specification instance either entirely from within R, from various command-line
wrappers (e.g., \emph{cwl-runner}) or from other languages (\emph{, e.g.,} Bash or Python).
\emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} includes support for both command-line and R/Bioconductor software
as well as resources for containerization, parallel evaluations on computer clusters
along with the automated generation of interactive analysis reports.

An important feature of \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR\textquotesingle{}s}} CWL interface is that it provides two
options to run command-line tools and workflows based on CWL. First, one can
run CWL in its native way via an R-based wrapper utility for \emph{cwl-runner} or
\emph{cwl-tools} (CWL-based approach). Second, one can run workflows using CWL's
command-line and workflow instructions from within R (R-based approach). In the
latter case the same CWL workflow definition files (\emph{e.g.} \texttt{*.cwl} and \texttt{*.yml})
are used but rendered and executed entirely with R functions defined by
\emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}}, and thus use CWL mainly as a command-line and workflow
definition format rather than software to run workflows. In this regard
\emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} also provides several convenience functions that are useful for
designing and debugging workflows, such as a command-line rendering function to
retrieve the exact command-line strings for each data set and processing step
prior to running a command-line.

This overview introduces the design of a new CWL S4 class in \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}},
as well as the custom command-line interface, combined with the overview of all
the common analysis steps of NGS experiments.

\hypertarget{workflow-design-structure-using-sysargs2}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Workflow design structure using \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}}}{Workflow design structure using SYSargs2}}\label{workflow-design-structure-using-sysargs2}}

The flexibility of \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR\textquotesingle{}s}} new interface workflow control class is the driving factor behind
the use of as many steps necessary for the analysis, as well as the connection
between command-line- or R-based software. The connectivity among all
workflow steps is achieved by the \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} workflow control class (see Figure 3).
This S4 class is a list-like container where each instance stores all the
input/output paths and parameter components required for a particular data
analysis step. \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} instances are generated by two constructor
functions, \emph{loadWorkflow} and \emph{renderWF}, using as data input \emph{targets} or
\emph{yaml} files as well as two \emph{cwl} parameter files (for details see below). When
running preconfigured workflows, the only input the user needs to provide is
the initial \emph{targets} file containing the paths to the input files (\emph{e.g.}
FASTQ) along with unique sample labels. Subsequent targets instances are
created automatically. The parameters required for running command-line
software is provided by the parameter (\emph{.cwl}) files described below.

We also introduce the \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2Pipe}} class that organizes one or many
SYSargs2 containers in a single compound object capturing all information
required to run, control and monitor complex workflows from start to finish. This
design enhances the \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} workflow framework with a generalized,
flexible, and robust design.

\textbf{Figure 2:} Workflow steps with input/output file operations are controlled by
\emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} objects. Each \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} instance is constructed from one \emph{targets}
and two \emph{param} files. The only input provided by the user is the initial \emph{targets}
file. Subsequent \emph{targets} instances are created automatically, from the previous
output files. Any number of predefined or custom workflow steps are supported. One
or many \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} objects are organized in an \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2Pipe}} container.

\hypertarget{workflow-management-using-sysargslist}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Workflow Management using \emph{\texttt{SYSargsList}}}{Workflow Management using SYSargsList}}\label{workflow-management-using-sysargslist}}

\textbf{systemPipeR} allows creation (multi-step analyses) and execution of workflow entirely for R, with control, flexibility, and scalability of the all process. The execution of the workflow can be sent to a HPC, can be parallelizes, accelerating results acquisition. A workflow management system provides an infrastructure for the set-up, performance and monitoring of a defined sequence of tasks, arranged as a workflow application.

\textbf{Figure 3:} Workflow Management using \emph{\texttt{SYSargsList}}.

\hypertarget{workflow-design-structure-using-sysargs-previous-version}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Workflow design structure using \emph{\texttt{SYSargs}}: Previous version}{Workflow design structure using SYSargs: Previous version}}\label{workflow-design-structure-using-sysargs-previous-version}}

Instances of this S4 object class are constructed by the \emph{\texttt{systemArgs}} function
from two simple tabular files: a \emph{\texttt{targets}} file and a \emph{\texttt{param}} file. The latter
is optional for workflow steps lacking command-line software. Typically, a
\emph{\texttt{SYSargs}} instance stores all sample-level inputs as well as the paths to the
corresponding outputs generated by command-line- or R-based software generating
sample-level output files, such as read preprocessors (trimmed/filtered FASTQ
files), aligners (SAM/BAM files), variant callers (VCF/BCF files) or peak callers
(BED/WIG files). Each sample level input/output operation uses its own \emph{\texttt{SYSargs}}
instance. The outpaths of \emph{\texttt{SYSargs}} usually define the sample inputs for the
next \emph{\texttt{SYSargs}} instance. This connectivity is established by writing the
outpaths with the \emph{\texttt{writeTargetsout}} function to a new \emph{\texttt{targets}} file that
serves as input to the next \emph{\texttt{systemArgs}} call. Typically, the user has to
provide only the initial \emph{\texttt{targets}} file. All downstream \emph{\texttt{targets}} files are
generated automatically. By chaining several \emph{\texttt{SYSargs}} steps together one can
construct complex workflows involving many sample-level input/output file
operations with any combination of command-line or R-based software.

The R software for running \href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/systemPipeR.html}{\emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}}} can be downloaded from \href{http://cran.at.r-project.org/}{\emph{CRAN}}. The \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} environment can be installed from the R console using the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/index.html}{\emph{\texttt{BiocManager::install}}} command. The associated data package \href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/systemPipeRdata.html}{\emph{\texttt{systemPipeRdata}}} can be installed the same way. The latter is a helper package for generating \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} workflow environments with a single command containing all parameter files and sample data required to quickly test and run workflows.

\hypertarget{load-sample-data-and-workflow-templates}{%
\subsection{Load sample data and workflow templates}\label{load-sample-data-and-workflow-templates}}

The mini sample FASTQ files used by this overview vignette as well as the
associated workflow reporting vignettes can be loaded via the \emph{\texttt{systemPipeRdata}}
package as shown below. The chosen data set \href{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP010938}{\texttt{SRP010938}}
obtains 18 paired-end (PE) read sets from \emph{Arabidposis thaliana} (Howard et al. 2013).
To minimize processing time during testing, each FASTQ file has been subsetted to
90,000-100,000 randomly sampled PE reads that map to the first 100,000 nucleotides
of each chromosome of the \emph{A. thalina} genome. The corresponding reference genome
sequence (FASTA) and its GFF annotation files (provided in the same download) have
been truncated accordingly. This way the entire test sample data set requires
less than 200MB disk storage space. A PE read set has been chosen for this test
data set for flexibility, because it can be used for testing both types of analysis
routines requiring either SE (single-end) reads or PE reads.

The following generates a fully populated \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} workflow environment
(here for RNA-Seq) in the current working directory of an R session. At this time
the package includes workflow templates for RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq, and Ribo-Seq.
Templates for additional NGS applications will be provided in the future.

\hypertarget{directory-structure}{%
\subsection{Directory Structure}\label{directory-structure}}

The working environment of the sample data loaded in the previous step contains
the following pre-configured directory structure (Figure 4). Directory names are indicated
in {\textbf{\emph{green}}}. Users can change this
structure as needed, but need to adjust the code in their workflows
accordingly.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {\emph{\textbf{workflow/}}} (\emph{e.g.} \emph{rnaseq/})

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is the root directory of the R session running the workflow.
  \item
    Run script ( \emph{*.Rmd}) and sample annotation (\emph{targets.txt}) files are located here.
  \item
    Note, this directory can have any name (\emph{e.g.} {\emph{\textbf{rnaseq}}}, {\emph{\textbf{varseq}}}). Changing its name does not require any modifications in the run script(s).
  \item
    \textbf{Important subdirectories}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      {\emph{\textbf{param/}}}

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Stores non-CWL parameter files such as: \emph{*.param}, \emph{*.tmpl} and \emph{*.run.sh}. These files are only required for backwards compatibility to run old workflows using the previous custom command-line interface.
      \item
        {\emph{\textbf{param/cwl/}}}: This subdirectory stores all the CWL parameter files. To organize workflows, each can have its own subdirectory, where all \texttt{CWL param} and \texttt{input.yml} files need to be in the same subdirectory.
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      {\emph{\textbf{data/}} }

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        FASTQ files
      \item
        FASTA file of reference (\emph{e.g.} reference genome)
      \item
        Annotation files
      \item
        etc.
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      {\emph{\textbf{results/}}}

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Analysis results are usually written to this directory, including: alignment, variant and peak files (BAM, VCF, BED); tabular result files; and image/plot files
      \item
        Note, the user has the option to organize results files for a given sample and analysis step in a separate subdirectory.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Figure 5:} \emph{systemPipeR's} preconfigured directory structure.

The following parameter files are included in each workflow template:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{\texttt{targets.txt}}: initial one provided by user; downstream \emph{\texttt{targets\_*.txt}} files are generated automatically
\item
  \emph{\texttt{*.param/cwl}}: defines parameter for input/output file operations, \emph{e.g.}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{\texttt{hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.cwl}}
  \item
    \emph{\texttt{hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.yml}}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{\texttt{*\_run.sh}}: optional bash scripts
\item
  Configuration files for computer cluster environments (skip on single machines):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{\texttt{.batchtools.conf.R}}: defines the type of scheduler for \emph{\texttt{batchtools}} pointing to template file of cluster, and located in user's home directory
  \item
    \emph{\texttt{*.tmpl}}: specifies parameters of scheduler used by a system, \emph{e.g.} Torque, SGE, Slurm, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{structure-of-targets-file}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Structure of \emph{\texttt{targets}} file}{Structure of targets file}}\label{structure-of-targets-file}}

The \emph{\texttt{targets}} file defines all input files (\emph{e.g.} FASTQ, BAM, BCF) and sample
comparisons of an analysis workflow. The following shows the format of a sample
\emph{\texttt{targets}} file included in the package. It also can be viewed and downloaded
from \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}}'s GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeR/blob/master/inst/extdata/targets.txt}{here}.
In a target file with a single type of input files, here FASTQ files of single-end (SE) reads, the first three columns are mandatory including their column
names, while it is four mandatory columns for FASTQ files of PE reads. All
subsequent columns are optional and any number of additional columns can be added as needed.

Users should note here, the usage of targets files is optional when using
\emph{systemPipeR's} new CWL interface. They can be replaced by a standard YAML
input file used by CWL. Since for organizing experimental variables targets
files are extremely useful and user-friendly. Thus, we encourage users to keep using
them.

To work with custom data, users need to generate a \emph{\texttt{targets}} file containing
the paths to their own FASTQ files and then provide under \emph{\texttt{targetspath}} the
path to the corresponding \emph{\texttt{targets}} file.

The function \emph{\texttt{readComp}} imports the comparison information and stores it in a
\emph{\texttt{list}}. Alternatively, \emph{\texttt{readComp}} can obtain the comparison information from
the corresponding \emph{\texttt{SYSargs}} object (see below). Note, these header lines are
optional. They are mainly useful for controlling comparative analyses according
to certain biological expectations, such as identifying differentially expressed
genes in RNA-Seq experiments based on simple pair-wise comparisons.

\emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} stores all the information and instructions needed for processing
a set of input files with a single or many command-line steps within a workflow
(\emph{i.e.} several components of the software or several independent software tools).
The \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} object is created and fully populated with the \emph{loadWF}
and \emph{renderWF} functions, respectively.

In CWL, files with the extension \emph{\texttt{.cwl}} define the parameters of a chosen
command-line step or workflow, while files with the extension \emph{\texttt{.yml}} define
the input variables of command-line steps. Note, input variables provided
by a \emph{targets} file can be passed on to a \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} instance via the \emph{inputvars}
argument of the \emph{renderWF} function.

The following imports a \emph{\texttt{.cwl}} file (here \emph{\texttt{hisat2-mapping-se.cwl}}) for running
the short read aligner HISAT2 (Kim, Langmead, and Salzberg 2015). The \emph{loadWorkflow} and \emph{renderWF}
functions render the proper command-line strings for each sample and software tool.

Of particular interest is the \emph{\texttt{cmdlist()}} method. It constructs the system
commands for running command-line software as specified by a given \emph{\texttt{.cwl}}
file combined with the paths to the input samples (\emph{e.g.} FASTQ files) provided
by a \emph{\texttt{targets}} file. The example below shows the \emph{\texttt{cmdlist()}} output for
running HISAT2 on the first SE read sample. Evaluating the output of
\emph{\texttt{cmdlist()}} can be very helpful for designing and debugging \emph{\texttt{.cwl}} files
of new command-line software or changing the parameter settings of existing
ones.

The output components of \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} define the expected output files for

In an `R-centric' rather than a `CWL-centric' workflow design the connectivity
among workflow steps is established by writing all relevant output with the
\emph{writeTargetsout} function to a new targets file that serves as input to the
next \emph{loadWorkflow} and \emph{renderWF} call. By chaining several \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} steps
together one can construct complex workflows involving many sample-level
input/output file operations with any combination of command-line or R-based
software. Alternatively, a CWL-centric workflow design can be used that defines
all/most workflow steps with CWL workflow and parameter files. Due to time and
space restrictions, the CWL-centric approach is not covered by this tutorial.

The \emph{\texttt{systemArgs}} function imports the definitions of both the \emph{\texttt{param}} file
and the \emph{\texttt{targets}} file, and stores all relevant information in a \emph{\texttt{SYSargs}}
object (S4 class). To run the pipeline without command-line software, one can
assign \emph{\texttt{NULL}} to \emph{\texttt{sysma}} instead of a \emph{\texttt{param}} file. In addition, one can
start \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} workflows with pre-generated BAM files by providing a
targets file where the \emph{\texttt{FileName}} column provides the paths to the BAM files.
Note, in the following example the usage of \emph{\texttt{suppressWarnings()}} is only relevant for
building this vignette. In typical workflows it should be removed.

Of particular interest is the \emph{\texttt{sysargs()}} method. It constructs the system
commands for running command-lined software as specified by a given \emph{\texttt{param}}
file combined with the paths to the input samples (\emph{e.g.} FASTQ files) provided
by a \emph{\texttt{targets}} file. The example below shows the \emph{\texttt{sysargs()}} output for
running TopHat2 on the first PE read sample. Evaluating the output of
\emph{\texttt{sysargs()}} can be very helpful for designing and debugging \emph{\texttt{param}} files
of new command-line software or changing the parameter settings of existing
ones.

At first encounter, you may wonder whether an operator such as \emph{\%\textgreater{}\%} can really be all that beneficial; but as you may notice, it semantically changes your code in a way that makes it more intuitive to both read and write.

This section of the tutorial provides an introduction to the usage of the \emph{systemPipeR} features on a cluster.

Now open the R markdown script \texttt{*.Rmd}in your R IDE (\_e.g.\_vim-r or RStudio) and run the workflow as outlined below. If you work under Vim-R-Tmux, the following command sequence will connect the user in an
interactive session with a node on the cluster. The code of the \texttt{Rmd}
script can then be sent from Vim on the login (head) node to an open R session running
on the corresponding computer node. This is important since Tmux sessions
should not be run on the computer nodes.

\hypertarget{parallelization-on-clusters}{%
\subsubsection{Parallelization on clusters}\label{parallelization-on-clusters}}

Alternatively, the computation can be greatly accelerated by processing many files
in parallel using several compute nodes of a cluster, where a scheduling/queuing
system is used for load balancing. For this the \emph{\texttt{clusterRun}} function submits
the computing requests to the scheduler using the run specifications
defined by \emph{\texttt{runCommandline}}.

To avoid over-subscription of CPU cores on the compute nodes, the value from
\emph{\texttt{yamlinput(args){[}\textquotesingle{}thread\textquotesingle{}{]}}} is passed on to the submission command, here \emph{\texttt{ncpus}}
in the \emph{\texttt{resources}} list object. The number of independent parallel cluster
processes is defined under the \emph{\texttt{Njobs}} argument. The following example will run
18 processes in parallel using for each 4 CPU cores. If the resources available
on a cluster allow running all 18 processes at the same time then the shown sample
submission will utilize in total 72 CPU cores. Note, \emph{\texttt{clusterRun}} can be used
with most queueing systems as it is based on utilities from the \emph{\texttt{batchtools}}
package which supports the use of template files (\emph{\texttt{*.tmpl}}) for defining the
run parameters of different schedulers. To run the following code, one needs to
have both a conf file (see \emph{\texttt{.batchtools.conf.R}} samples \href{https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/}{here})
and a template file (see \emph{\texttt{*.tmpl}} samples \href{https://github.com/mllg/batchtools/tree/master/inst/templates}{here})
for the queueing available on a system. The following example uses the sample
conf and template files for the Slurm scheduler provided by this package.

\hypertarget{define-environment-settings-and-samples}{%
\subsection{Define environment settings and samples}\label{define-environment-settings-and-samples}}

A typical workflow starts with generating the expected working environment
containing the proper directory structure, input files, and parameter settings.
To simplify this task, one can load one of the existing NGS workflows templates
provided by \emph{\texttt{systemPipeRdata}} into the current working directory. The
following does this for the \emph{\texttt{rnaseq}} template. The name of the resulting
workflow directory can be specified under the \emph{\texttt{mydirname}} argument. The
default \emph{\texttt{NULL}} uses the name of the chosen workflow. An error is issued if a
directory of the same name and path exists already. On Linux and OS X systems
one can also create new workflow instances from the command-line of a terminal as shown
\href{http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/systemPipeRdata/inst/doc/systemPipeRdata.html\#generate-workflow-template}{here}.
To apply workflows to custom data, the user needs to modify the \emph{\texttt{targets}} file and if
necessary update the corresponding \emph{\texttt{.cwl}} and \emph{\texttt{.yml}} files. A collection of pre-generated \emph{\texttt{.cwl}} and \emph{\texttt{.yml}} files are provided in the \emph{\texttt{param/cwl}} subdirectory of each workflow template. They
are also viewable in the GitHub repository of \emph{\texttt{systemPipeRdata}} (\href{https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/tree/master/inst/extdata/param}{see

\hypertarget{preprocessing-with-preprocessreads-function}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Preprocessing with \emph{\texttt{preprocessReads}} function}{Preprocessing with preprocessReads function}}\label{preprocessing-with-preprocessreads-function}}

The function \emph{\texttt{preprocessReads}} allows to apply predefined or custom
read preprocessing functions to all FASTQ files referenced in a
\emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} container, such as quality filtering or adaptor trimming
routines. The paths to the resulting output FASTQ files are stored in the
\emph{\texttt{output}} slot of the \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} object. Internally,
\emph{\texttt{preprocessReads}} uses the \emph{\texttt{FastqStreamer}} function from
the \emph{\texttt{ShortRead}} package to stream through large FASTQ files in a
memory-efficient manner. The following example performs adaptor trimming with
the \emph{\texttt{trimLRPatterns}} function from the \emph{\texttt{Biostrings}} package.
After the trimming step a new targets file is generated (here
\emph{\texttt{targets\_trimPE.txt}}) containing the paths to the trimmed FASTQ files.
The new targets file can be used for the next workflow step with an updated
\emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} instance, \emph{e.g.} running the NGS alignments with the
trimmed FASTQ files.

Construct \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} object from \emph{\texttt{cwl}} and \emph{\texttt{yml}} param and \emph{\texttt{targets}} files.

To simplify the short read alignment execution for the user, the command-line
can be run with the \emph{\texttt{runCommandline}} function.
The execution will be on a single machine without submitting to a queuing system
of a computer cluster. This way, the input FASTQ files will be processed sequentially.
By default \emph{\texttt{runCommandline}} auto detects SAM file outputs and converts them
to sorted and indexed BAM files, using internally the \texttt{Rsamtools} package
(Morgan et al. 2019). Besides, \emph{\texttt{runCommandline}} allows the user to create a dedicated
results folder for each workflow and a sub-folder for each sample
defined in the \emph{targets} file. This includes all the output and log files for each
step. When these options are used, the output location will be updated by default
and can be assigned to the same object.

\begin{Shaded}

Assigning the new extention of the output files to the object args.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If available, multiple CPU cores can be used for processing each file. The number
of CPU cores (here 4) to use for each process is defined in the \emph{\texttt{*.yml}} file.
With \emph{\texttt{yamlinput(args){[}\textquotesingle{}thread\textquotesingle{}{]}}} one can return this value from the \emph{\texttt{SYSargs2}} object.

\hypertarget{parallelization-on-clusters-1}{%
\paragraph{Parallelization on clusters}\label{parallelization-on-clusters-1}}

Alternatively, the computation can be greatly accelerated by processing many files
in parallel using several compute nodes of a cluster, where a scheduling/queuing
system is used for load balancing. For this the \emph{\texttt{clusterRun}} function submits
the computing requests to the scheduler using the run specifications
defined by \emph{\texttt{runCommandline}}.

To avoid over-subscription of CPU cores on the compute nodes, the value from
\emph{\texttt{yamlinput(args){[}\textquotesingle{}thread\textquotesingle{}{]}}} is passed on to the submission command, here \emph{\texttt{ncpus}}
in the \emph{\texttt{resources}} list object. The number of independent parallel cluster
processes is defined under the \emph{\texttt{Njobs}} argument. The following example will run
18 processes in parallel using for each 4 CPU cores. If the resources available
on a cluster allow running all 18 processes at the same time then the shown sample
submission will utilize in total 72 CPU cores. Note, \emph{\texttt{clusterRun}} can be used
with most queueing systems as it is based on utilities from the \emph{\texttt{batchtools}}
package which supports the use of template files (\emph{\texttt{*.tmpl}}) for defining the
run parameters of different schedulers. To run the following code, one needs to
have both a conf file (see \emph{\texttt{.batchtools.conf.R}} samples \href{https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/}{here})
and a template file (see \emph{\texttt{*.tmpl}} samples \href{https://github.com/mllg/batchtools/tree/master/inst/templates}{here})
for the queueing available on a system. The following example uses the sample
conf and template files for the Slurm scheduler provided by this package.

\subsection{Create symbolic links for viewing BAM files in IGV}\label{create-symbolic-links-for-viewing-bam-files-in-igv}}

The genome browser IGV supports reading of indexed/sorted BAM files via web URLs. This way it can be avoided to create unnecessary copies of these large files. To enable this approach, an HTML directory with Http access needs to be available in the user account (\emph{e.g.} \emph{\texttt{home/publichtml}}) of a system. If this is not the case then the BAM files need to be moved or copied to the system where IGV runs. In the following, \emph{\texttt{htmldir}} defines the path to the HTML directory with http access where the symbolic links to the BAM files will be stored. The corresponding URLs will be written to a text file specified under the \texttt{\_urlfile}\_ argument.

Please note, in addition to read counts this step generates RPKM normalized expression values. For most statistical differential expression or abundance analysis methods, such as \emph{\texttt{edgeR}} or \emph{\texttt{DESeq2}}, the raw count values should be used as input. The usage of RPKM values should be restricted to specialty applications required by some users, \emph{e.g.} manually comparing the expression levels of different genes or features.

Read counting with \emph{\texttt{summarizeOverlaps}} using multiple nodes of a cluster.

A useful feature is the possibility to combine the counts from several Venn comparisons with the same number of sample sets in a single Venn diagram (here for 4 up and down DEG sets).

\subsubsection{Obtain gene-to-GO mappings}\label{obtain-gene-to-go-mappings}}

The following shows how to obtain gene-to-GO mappings from \emph{\texttt{biomaRt}} (here for \emph{A. thaliana}) and how to organize them for the downstream GO term enrichment analysis. Alternatively, the gene-to-GO mappings can be obtained for many organisms from Bioconductor's \emph{\texttt{*.db}} genome annotation packages or GO annotation files provided by various genome databases. For each annotation, this relatively slow preprocessing step needs to be performed only once. Subsequently, the preprocessed data can be loaded with the \emph{\texttt{load}} function as shown in the next subsection.

\hypertarget{batch-go-term-enrichment-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Batch GO term enrichment analysis}\label{batch-go-term-enrichment-analysis}}

Apply the enrichment analysis to the DEG sets obtained in the above differential expression analysis. Note, in the following example the \emph{FDR} filter is set here to an unreasonably high value, simply because of the small size of the toy data set used in this vignette. Batch enrichment analysis of many gene sets is performed with the \emph{\texttt{GOCluster\_Report}} function. When \emph{\texttt{method="all"}}, it returns all GO terms passing the p-value cutoff specified under the \emph{\texttt{cutoff}} arguments. When \emph{\texttt{method="slim"}}, it returns only the GO terms specified under the \emph{\texttt{myslimv}} argument. The given example shows how one can obtain such a GO slim vector from BioMart for a specific organism.

Because of the variable size of the sample sets, it may not always be desirable to show the results from different DEG sets in the same bar plot.

\hypertarget{workflow-templates}{%
\section{Workflow templates}\label{workflow-templates}}

The intended way of running \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}} workflows is via \emph{\texttt{*.Rmd}} files, which
can be executed either line-wise in interactive mode or with a single command from
R or the command-line. This way comprehensive and reproducible analysis reports
can be generated in PDF or HTML format in a fully automated manner by making use
of the highly functional reporting utilities available for R.
The following shows how to execute a workflow (\emph{e.g.}, systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd)
from the command-line.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{Rscript}\NormalTok{ -e }\StringTok{"rmarkdown::render('systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd')"}

\end{Shaded}

Templates for setting up custom project reports are provided as \emph{\texttt{*.Rmd}} files by the helper package \emph{\texttt{systemPipeRdata}} and in the vignettes subdirectory of \emph{\texttt{systemPipeR}}. The corresponding HTML of these report templates are available here: \href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/systemPipeRdata/inst/doc/systemPipeRNAseq.html}{\emph{\texttt{systemPipeRNAseq}}}, \href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/systemPipeRdata/inst/doc/systemPipeRIBOseq.html}{\emph{\texttt{systemPipeRIBOseq}}}, \href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/systemPipeRdata/inst/doc/systemPipeChIPseq.html}{\emph{\texttt{systemPipeChIPseq}}} and \href{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/systemPipeRdata/inst/doc/systemPipeVARseq.html}{\emph{\texttt{systemPipeVARseq}}}. To work with \emph{\texttt{*.Rnw}} or \emph{\texttt{*.Rmd}} files efficiently, basic knowledge of \href{https://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/}{\emph{\texttt{Sweave}}} or \href{http://yihui.name/knitr/}{\emph{\texttt{knitr}}} and \href{http://www.latex-project.org/}{\emph{\texttt{Latex}}} or \href{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/}{\emph{\texttt{R Markdown v2}}} is required.
