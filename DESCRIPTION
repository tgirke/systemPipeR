Description: R package for building and running automated end-to-end analysis workflows for a wide range of next generation sequence (NGS) applications such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and Ribo-Seq. Important features include a uniform workflow interface across different NGS applications, automated report generation, and support for running both R and command-line software, such as NGS aligners or peak/variant callers, on local computers or compute clusters. Efficient handling of complex sample sets and experimental designs is facilitated by a consistently implemented sample annotation infrastructure. Instructions for using systemPipeR are given in the Overview Vignette (HTML). The remaining Vignettes, linked below, are workflow templates for common NGS use cases.
Depends: Rsamtools (>= 1.31.2), Biostrings, ShortRead (>= 1.37.1), methods
Imports: GenomicRanges, GenomicFeatures (>= 1.31.3), SummarizedExperiment, VariantAnnotation (>= 1.25.11), rjson, ggplot2, grid, limma, edgeR, DESeq2, GOstats, GO.db, annotate, pheatmap, batchtools, yaml, stringr, assertthat
Suggests: BiocGenerics, ape, RUnit, BiocStyle, knitr, rmarkdown, biomaRt, BiocParallel, BiocManager, systemPipeRdata, GenomicAlignments, magrittr
VignetteBuilder: knitr
SystemRequirements: systemPipeR can be used to run external 
        command-line software (e.g. short read aligners), but the 
        corresponding tool needs to be installed on a system.
