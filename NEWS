CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3
----------------------

OVERVIEW 
    systemPipeR is an R/Bioconductor package for building and running automated
    analysis workflows for a wide range of next generation sequence (NGS)
    applications. Important features include automated report generation and
    support for running both R and command-line software, such as NGS aligners
    or peak/variant callers, on local computers or compute clusters. Efficient 
    handling of complex sample sets and experimental designs is facilitated by a 
    consistently implemented sample annotation infrastructure. 
    
    Due to the broad scope and application spectrum of systemPipeR, the
    package will remain under heavy development for quite some time. The most
    important enhancements in the upcoming release are outlined below.

NGS WORKFLOWS

    o Added new end-to-end workflows for 3 additional NGS application areas: 
        - Ribo-Seq and polyRibo-Seq 
        - ChIP-Seq
        - VAR-Seq
      The previous version of systemPipeR included only a complete workflow for
      RNA-Seq.

    o Added the data package 'systemPipeRdata' to generate systemPipeR workflow
      environments with a single command (genWorkenvir) containing all parameter
      files and sample data required to quickly test and run workflows. This
      change will also allow evaluation of much more code examples in the
      vignettes during the package build/test process than this was possible in
      the past. 

    o About 20 new functions have been added to the package. Some examples are:
        - Read pre-processor function with support for SE and PE reads
        - Parallelization option of detailed FASTQ quality reports
        - Read distribution plots across all features available in a 
          genome annotation (see ?featuretypeCounts) 
        - Visualization of coverage trends along transcripts summarized 
          for any number of transcripts (see ?featureCoverage)
        - Differential expression/binding analysis includes now DESeq2 as
          well as edgeR

    o Added param templates for additional command-line software including, but 
      not limited to: BWA-MEM, GATK, BCFtools, MACS2

    o Adaption of R Markdown for main vignette. Plans are to provide in the
      future the report templates for all workflows in both formats: Latex/PDF
      and R_Markdown/HTML.

WORFLOW FRAMEWORK

    o Simplified design of complex analysis workflows. Workflows can now include
      any number or combination of R and/or command-line steps

    o Improvements to workflow automation and parallelization on single
      machines and computer clusters. This also includes now many additional
      parallelization examples in the workflow vignettes.
